# 10 1st games challenge

In the game maker community there's a saying  
```
Your first 10 games are going to suck so better get them out of the way quick
```
And I understand why. IT's VERY hard to think small enough which can lead to overbloating and feature creep real quick.  
The idea of this repo is to give you (at least) 10 small ideas to practice your game making skills from end to end (yes, that includes documentation and distribution)  

I can not guarantee you will become a GOOD game maker, only that you will gain some experience  
your first 10 original games might still suck for other reasons but at least you'll know what to expect by that point  

|Genre| Name | description| perceived difficulty (aka before trying) | actual difficulty (after executing)|

|Incremental Game| \<Thing\> clicker| if you have played cookie clicker or decision problem you  know this genre already go and do your own| 1/5 | ?/5 |



# DISCLAIMER
I had the idea for this repo literally as I was falling asleep yesterday and I'm on my second game myself (1st if you think only solo projects).  
I don't know how deep/shallow/simple/complex the ideas and documents will be but wanted to put the idea out there  
Feel free to raise an issue/feature req and we can discuss them :)  
just be patient, I know this idea has potential because other "app idea for practice" repos are popular but I'm still very new to this and the point is for all of us to learn together
